Innovation is about you try and try 
Go beyond it, the limit is not the sky.
Remember What When How Where and Why
Sky is open for you where you can fly.

Git is a  version control 
Github is a website hwre you can do projects using version control
Repository : Project
Commit: Saving the changes 
Commit hash : unique code to identify the commit
Branching in github: WE can make chnages and commit a file other than the main branch 
for knowing if we have two possibilities at the same time
WE can also merge if we make changes to both the branches   main and subbranch
